# TODO

Keep this file limited to actionable work. Remove completed items and empty
sections after their implementation has been verified and committed.

## Shared artifact consolidation

- [x] Move the duplicated PCM16 WAV writer and generated-audio WAV reader to
      `vntts-artifacts v0.3.0`; consume its format constant and shared text hash
      without adding game-specific or application-state behavior to the package.
- [ ] After the current product work stabilizes, consolidate repeated CLI exit,
      stderr, and structured-result handling behind a repository-local helper;
      keep individual argument parsers explicit.

## Live mode

### P0 - Validate performance and resilience

- [ ] Validate the live-mode acceptance targets on supported hardware:
  - No audio underruns or buzzing during a 30-minute live session.
  - Start a cached-voice sentence within 2 seconds on the supported CPU target
    and within 750 ms on the supported CUDA target.
  - Start an already-visible second sentence within 300 ms of the first ending.
  - Never speak or advance stale OCR generations.

### P1 - Benchmark remaining backends and hardware

- [ ] Benchmark XTTS and Chatterbox Nano on the target Windows CPU and CUDA
      hardware; compare first-audio latency, realtime factor, speaker similarity,
      hallucinations, RAM/VRAM, and package size.
- [ ] Prototype Chatterbox Turbo for English CUDA voice cloning and compare it
      with the existing XTTS and Chatterbox Nano measurements.
- [ ] Keep F5-TTS as a GPU quality/performance comparison, not the initial live
      backend, because its strongest published latency path depends on
      TensorRT-LLM-class GPU deployment.

### P1 - Evaluate OCR replacement only after pipeline optimization

- [ ] Validate the optional RapidOCR backend in the Windows portable build and
      compare it with Tesseract on the target Windows hardware.

### P1 - Live-mode integration and safety tests

- [ ] Add real Windows and macOS soak tests covering CPU and GPU speech, animated
      scenes, rapid manual advancement, and application shutdown during every
      pipeline stage.

## Windows application

### P2 - Windows distribution

- [ ] Produce a standalone Windows build on Windows.
  - [ ] Build on Windows and confirm Python, Qt, Tesseract, English language
        data, and eSpeak-NG are present in the portable artifact.
  - [ ] Verify operation without Python, uv, Tesseract, or development tools installed.

- [ ] Create and sign a Windows installer.
  - Add Start Menu shortcuts, optional startup, upgrades, and clean uninstall support.
  - Preserve downloaded models and user settings during application upgrades.
  - Sign the executable and installer for public distribution.

- [ ] Add Windows compatibility and release testing.
  - Cover Windows 11, common GPU vendors, multiple displays, and DPI scaling.
  - Cover windowed, borderless, normal-user, and elevated game processes.
  - Run installation and OCR-to-speech smoke tests on a clean Windows machine.
