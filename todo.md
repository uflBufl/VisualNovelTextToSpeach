# TODO

Keep this file limited to actionable work. Remove completed items and empty
sections after their implementation has been verified and committed.

## Offline authoring and application responsibility split

### P1 - Preserve existing generation work

- [ ] Generate and review the 1,220 `no_audio` patch 3.7 lines with the approved
      `moss-tts-local-transformer-v1.5-mlx` model after their voice references
      are available. Preserve source-audio candidates instead of replacing them
      with generated speech.

### P1 - Make authoring workbench controls visible and discoverable

- [ ] Redesign the secondary workbench pane so expanding the window or a detail
      section cannot leave Generation scope, Readiness details, Voice references,
      or Technical details as empty header-sized frames while only the dialogue
      review grid grows. Put the secondary content in a vertically scrollable
      inspector, replace the status-like `QGroupBox` checkboxes with disclosure
      chevrons, and ensure expanding a section makes its first controls visible
      without shrinking the review pane below its usable minimum. Preserve each
      section's workspace-local expanded state, keep Reset layout available, and
      add Qt regressions for the default, resized, and persisted-all-expanded
      layouts that prove every expanded control is visible or scroll-reachable.

## Live mode

### P0 - Repair failures observed in the latest Character Story run

- [ ] Re-run the chapter opening and verify that indexed incomplete prefixes
      are never spoken or auto-advanced. The 2026-08-16 run spoke only 43, 13,
      and 44 characters of the first three 94, 24, and 69-character lines;
      each fragment now resolves as one unique incomplete story prefix and must
      remain pending until the full line or a verified generated route is ready.
- [ ] Validate the explicit Narrator voice dialog: selecting a candidate must
      bypass pregenerated narrator tracks with the chosen live voice, while
      "Use pregenerated narrator tracks when available" must remove that
      override and restore artifact routing. On the same fixed narration line,
      compare Centurion with Paper Heron after extractor-owned, game-derived
      Paper Heron references are available; the current Matilda-like result was
      rejected as insufficiently confident and presentational.
  - [ ] Preserve the completed Rhiannon review when the chosen Narrator creates
        a new config-addressed workspace. Add an explicit, non-destructive
        carry-forward operation that accepts only terminal non-Narrator
        outcomes whose queue item, exact character references, model, profile,
        synthesis text and WAV hashes still match. Never carry Narrator audio,
        silently reinterpret a changed manifest, or discard the existing
        Rhiannon decisions; fail closed to explicit regeneration when the
        per-item controls cannot be proven equivalent.
  - [ ] After the narrator comparison is decided, regenerate only Narrator
        queue IDs in the chosen workspace while retaining the proven Rhiannon
        outcomes, then expose the resulting approved-only manifest for the
        Character Story generated-audio routing acceptance run.
- [ ] Validate unique-prefix generated-audio routing in the next Character Story
      run. The 2026-08-16 baseline delayed generation start by as much as 11 s
      even though Pocket itself reached first PCM roughly 6-143 ms later; the
      new route must start the verified WAV during the typewriter animation and
      fall back safely for short, ambiguous, or OCR-corrupted prefixes.
- [ ] Repeat the Character Story run after connecting the approved generated
      manifest. The 2026-08-16 run reduced route-level `story-line-no-match` to
      2 of 9 observations, but still produced a partial suffix and the bogus
      speaker `Oe`; verify that generated Rhiannon lines route to local WAVs.
- [ ] Validate the 250 ms Pocket TTS stream prefill on real audio output. The
      2026-08-16 run still recorded 3 underruns with the previous 120 ms lead;
      retain the new underrun count as acceptance evidence.

### P0 - Reproduce and gate the Rhiannon Character Story

- [ ] Capture a deterministic replay corpus from the reported Rhiannon
      Character Story/Anecdote, including Rhiannon, Hotelier, Adar Llwch Gwin
      Fledgling, narration, the short `I, erhm ...` line with transient
      nameplate/background OCR noise, an installed source-audio line, and a
      line that requires live synthesis.
- [ ] Pass a 20-line real-game acceptance run with no stale or duplicate speech,
      no skipped dialogue, no early advances over original audio, and automatic
      progression of every tested dialogue line.

### P0 - Establish a MOSS quality and latency gate

- [ ] Run `vntts-benchmark-tts` on the completed exact Rhiannon replay corpus,
      add generated/original game-audio route timing, and retain the report as
      acceptance evidence. The reported-line regression already covers fresh,
      memory/persistent cache, first-chunk timing, realtime factor, and the
      missed-EOS safety cap. Underrun remains a real-device hardware acceptance
      gate because the render-only benchmark does not open an output device.
- [ ] Run a small blinded listening comparison for Rhiannon speaker similarity,
      pronunciation, prosody, noise, repetitions, and trailing silence. Compare
      the stable generation profile with the current reference codec roundtrip
      and the original extracted line before tuning sampling again.
- [ ] Finish the manual contamination review and blinded comparison of the three
      objectively passing Rhiannon references, then decide whether to keep the
      documented first-reference policy, select another clean reference, or
      build and validate a combined prompt. Objective preflight cannot detect
      music or a second speaker reliably.
- [ ] Validate the selected 4-frame/0.25-second MOSS stream on real audio output
      during the hardware soak. The local discard-sink grid reduced first PCM
      from about 1264 ms to 640 ms at RTF 0.88, but cannot expose driver jitter.

### P1 - Simplify the live speech boundary after the P0 replay passes

- [ ] Remove the deprecated concrete-backend `prepare()`/`play()` and mutable
      `last_*` compatibility facade in a major release after an external API
      usage audit and documented migration window. Internal playback and the
      benchmark already use typed call-bound results.

### P0 - Validate performance and resilience

- [ ] Validate the live-mode acceptance targets on supported hardware:
  - No audio underruns or buzzing during a 30-minute live session.
  - Start a cached-voice sentence within 2 seconds on the supported CPU target
    and within 750 ms on the supported CUDA target.
  - Start an already-visible second sentence within 300 ms of the first ending.
  - Never speak or advance stale OCR generations.

### P1 - Benchmark remaining backends and hardware

- [ ] Complete the authoring workflow's perceptual model gate before adding
      another production speech backend, then integrate only the selected
      winner.
- [ ] Benchmark XTTS and Chatterbox Nano on the target Windows CPU and CUDA
      hardware; compare first-audio latency, realtime factor, speaker similarity,
      hallucinations, RAM/VRAM, and package size.
- [ ] Prototype Chatterbox Turbo for English CUDA voice cloning and compare it
      with the existing XTTS and Chatterbox Nano measurements.
- [ ] Keep F5-TTS as a GPU quality/performance comparison, not the initial live
      backend, because its strongest published latency path depends on
      TensorRT-LLM-class GPU deployment.

### P1 - Evaluate OCR replacement only after pipeline optimization

- [ ] Validate the optional RapidOCR backend in the Windows portable build and
      compare it with Tesseract on the target Windows hardware.

### P1 - Live-mode integration and safety tests

- [ ] Add real Windows and macOS soak tests covering CPU and GPU speech, animated
      scenes, rapid manual advancement, and application shutdown during every
      pipeline stage.

## Windows application

### P2 - Windows distribution

- [ ] Produce a standalone Windows build on Windows.
  - [ ] Build on Windows and confirm Python, Qt, Tesseract, English language
        data, and eSpeak-NG are present in the portable artifact.
  - [ ] Verify operation without Python, uv, Tesseract, or development tools installed.

- [ ] Create and sign a Windows installer.
  - Add Start Menu shortcuts, optional startup, upgrades, and clean uninstall support.
  - Preserve downloaded models and user settings during application upgrades.
  - Sign the executable and installer for public distribution.

- [ ] Run and record Windows compatibility and release qualification evidence.
  - Cover Windows 11, common GPU vendors, multiple displays, and DPI scaling.
  - Cover windowed, borderless, normal-user, and elevated game processes.
  - Cover a 30-minute soak, rapid and manual advancement, and shutdown during
    every live-pipeline stage.
  - Run installation and OCR-to-speech smoke tests on a clean Windows machine.
