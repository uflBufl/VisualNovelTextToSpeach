### P0 - Maximize pregenerated coverage without losing speaker identity

Follow the evidence-backed order and invariants in
[`docs/pregeneration-coverage-plan.md`](docs/pregeneration-coverage-plan.md).

- [ ] Complete the published cluster-specific review for the four accepted
      reference variants. The bounded fixed-corpus run published 9 of 16 WAVs;
      five typed audio-limit and two speech-silence failures must remain visible
      rather than becoming listening audio. Source-audio technical acceptance
      must not imply generated cadence, pronunciation or speaker-similarity
      approval. After the four explicit decisions, publish only accepted
      variants with `build-reference-bindings`, then create a new
      config-addressed workspace. Exact queue-ID binding is already implemented;
      it intentionally cannot choose a reference without the listening decision.

- [ ] Finish the checksum-bound Character Story audition for Aderyn, Mrs. Owen
      and Hotelier, then create a new config-addressed workspace and re-run
      preflight. Aderyn's Father, Dobharchú and Poacher are imported from the
      exact user-selected media and cover 55 of the current 237 blocked lines.
      Keep Aderyn's `hero3146` and `npcnoname326` portrait groups separate; the
      crying-only media `369040295` and `172299031` are rejected. Mrs. Owen's
      technically passing clip remains uncertain because its speech was not
      intelligible to the reviewer, and Hotelier has no minimum-duration pass.
      Do not merge `Poacher I`, `Poacher II` or Glyndŵr or treat
      configured-unavailable audio as installed.
- [ ] Manually audition reference candidates for the exact typed
      `reference_comparison` failure cohorts, then publish each chosen ordering
      with `select-reference` and generate only its explicit queue IDs. Objective
      `reference-report` metrics cannot decide speaker identity, background
      contamination or pronunciation. Keep the 20-second ceiling and do not
      mass retry a low-yield cohort.
- [ ] Generate and review the 1,220 `no_audio` patch 3.7 lines with the approved
      primary model and fallback policy after references are ready. Preserve
      source-audio candidates, invalidate review on changed WAV hashes, review
      every technical flag plus a stratified clean sample, and expand review
      whenever that sample finds a substantive cohort defect.

## Live mode

### P0 - Repair failures observed in the latest Character Story run

- [ ] Re-run the chapter opening and verify that indexed incomplete prefixes
      are never spoken or auto-advanced. The 2026-08-16 run spoke only 43, 13,
      and 44 characters of the first three 94, 24, and 69-character lines;
      each fragment now resolves as one unique incomplete story prefix and must
      remain pending until the full line or a verified generated route is ready.
- [ ] Validate the split Narrator controls in a real Character Story run:
      approved pregenerated Centurion tracks take precedence, while Pocket uses
      Centurion only as the missing/failed live fallback. Retain Paper Heron as
      an ordinary character voice. The current approved-only manifest has 69
      entries; the 61 remaining clean Narrator WAVs need the risk-based review
      policy above rather than another unconditional listen-all gate.
- [ ] Validate unique-prefix generated-audio routing in the next Character Story
      run. The 2026-08-16 baseline delayed generation start by as much as 11 s
      even though Pocket itself reached first PCM roughly 6-143 ms later; the
      new route must start the verified WAV during the typewriter animation and
      fall back safely for short, ambiguous, or OCR-corrupted prefixes.
- [ ] Repeat the Character Story run after connecting the approved generated
      manifest. The 2026-08-16 run reduced route-level `story-line-no-match` to
      2 of 9 observations, but still produced a partial suffix and the bogus
      speaker `Oe`; verify that generated Rhiannon lines route to local WAVs.
- [ ] Validate the 250 ms Pocket TTS stream prefill on real audio output. The
      2026-08-16 run still recorded 3 underruns with the previous 120 ms lead;
      retain the new underrun count as acceptance evidence.

### P0 - Reproduce and gate the Rhiannon Character Story

- [ ] Capture a deterministic replay corpus from the reported Rhiannon
      Character Story/Anecdote, including Rhiannon, Hotelier, Adar Llwch Gwin
      Fledgling, narration, the short `I, erhm ...` line with transient
      nameplate/background OCR noise, an installed source-audio line, and a
      line that requires live synthesis.
- [ ] Pass a 20-line real-game acceptance run with no stale or duplicate speech,
      no skipped dialogue, no early advances over original audio, and automatic
      progression of every tested dialogue line.

### P0 - Establish a MOSS quality and latency gate

- [ ] Run `vntts-benchmark-tts` on the completed exact Rhiannon replay corpus,
      add generated/original game-audio route timing, and retain the report as
      acceptance evidence. The reported-line regression already covers fresh,
      memory/persistent cache, first-chunk timing, realtime factor, and the
      missed-EOS safety cap. Underrun remains a real-device hardware acceptance
      gate because the render-only benchmark does not open an output device.
- [ ] Run a small blinded listening comparison for Rhiannon speaker similarity,
      pronunciation, prosody, noise, repetitions, and trailing silence. Compare
      the stable generation profile with the current reference codec roundtrip
      and the original extracted line before tuning sampling again.
- [ ] Finish the manual contamination review and blinded comparison of the three
      objectively passing Rhiannon references, then decide whether to keep the
      documented first-reference policy, select another clean reference, or
      build and validate a combined prompt. Objective preflight cannot detect
      music or a second speaker reliably.
- [ ] Validate the selected 4-frame/0.25-second MOSS stream on real audio output
      during the hardware soak. The local discard-sink grid reduced first PCM
      from about 1264 ms to 640 ms at RTF 0.88, but cannot expose driver jitter.

### P1 - Simplify the live speech boundary after the P0 replay passes

- [ ] Remove the deprecated concrete-backend `prepare()`/`play()` and mutable
      `last_*` compatibility facade in a major release after an external API
      usage audit and documented migration window. Internal playback and the
      benchmark already use typed call-bound results.

### P0 - Validate performance and resilience

- [ ] Validate the live-mode acceptance targets on supported hardware:
  - No audio underruns or buzzing during a 30-minute live session.
  - Start a cached-voice sentence within 2 seconds on the supported CPU target
    and within 750 ms on the supported CUDA target.
  - Start an already-visible second sentence within 300 ms of the first ending.
  - Never speak or advance stale OCR generations.

### P1 - Benchmark remaining backends and hardware

- [ ] Complete the authoring workflow's perceptual model gate before adding
      another production speech backend, then integrate only the selected
      winner.
- [ ] Benchmark XTTS and Chatterbox Nano on the target Windows CPU and CUDA
      hardware; compare first-audio latency, realtime factor, speaker similarity,
      hallucinations, RAM/VRAM, and package size.
- [ ] Prototype Chatterbox Turbo for English CUDA voice cloning and compare it
      with the existing XTTS and Chatterbox Nano measurements.
- [ ] Keep F5-TTS as a GPU quality/performance comparison, not the initial live
      backend, because its strongest published latency path depends on
      TensorRT-LLM-class GPU deployment.

### P1 - Evaluate OCR replacement only after pipeline optimization

- [ ] Validate the optional RapidOCR backend in the Windows portable build and
      compare it with Tesseract on the target Windows hardware.

### P1 - Live-mode integration and safety tests

- [ ] Add real Windows and macOS soak tests covering CPU and GPU speech, animated
      scenes, rapid manual advancement, and application shutdown during every
      pipeline stage.

## Windows application

### P2 - Windows distribution

- [ ] Produce a standalone Windows build on Windows.
  - [ ] Build on Windows and confirm Python, Qt, Tesseract, English language
        data, and eSpeak-NG are present in the portable artifact.
  - [ ] Verify operation without Python, uv, Tesseract, or development tools installed.

- [ ] Create and sign a Windows installer.
  - Add Start Menu shortcuts, optional startup, upgrades, and clean uninstall support.
  - Preserve downloaded models and user settings during application upgrades.
  - Sign the executable and installer for public distribution.

- [ ] Run and record Windows compatibility and release qualification evidence.
  - Cover Windows 11, common GPU vendors, multiple displays, and DPI scaling.
  - Cover windowed, borderless, normal-user, and elevated game processes.
  - Cover a 30-minute soak, rapid and manual advancement, and shutdown during
    every live-pipeline stage.
  - Run installation and OCR-to-speech smoke tests on a clean Windows machine.
